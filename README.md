### What is EEG data?
- EEG (Electroencephalogram) data refers to the electrical activity of the brain recorded over a specific period.
- This activity is captured using electrodes placed on the scalp, which detect the minute electrical changes resulting from the synchronized activity of neural assemblies.
- EEG data can provide insights into different states of consciousness, cognitive processes, and potential neurological abnormalities.
